### 💼 About me  

I’m a Full Stack Developer currently studying Computer Engineering, with a deep interest in **cybersecurity** and the impact of technology on people’s safety and privacy.
My background includes experience in algorithm development, computational aerodynamics, and secure software practices. I've worked with JavaScript, PHP, and Python, always seeking to write clean, efficient, and secure code.
What drives me is the desire to **protect people** in an increasingly connected world. I believe cybersecurity is not just about systems—it's about **ethics**, **responsibility**, and **trust**. With a strong eye for detail and a mindset shaped by analytical problem-solving, I’m committed to contributing to a safer and more resilient digital environment.

🔍 Always learning, always improving — let’s build secure tech together!
